# Smart-Fridge

Hi there, My name is Tanguy and I am a student Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Howest. This is a repo of my final project of the year. All of the instructions are listed in my instructable that you can find here(https://www.instructables.com/Smart-Fridge-Tools-and-Materials/).


step 1: Download Raspbian and write the immage file on your raspberry pi 4 SD-card.

step 2: Power on the raspberry and plug in an ethernet cable.

step 3: Edit the wifi config file via Putty(for this you will need the ip of your raspberry).

step 3: Clone the repository.

step 4: Type this in the commandline 'sudo pip3 install adafruit_ssd1306'.

step 5: After these steps you'll need to make a service so your program will start up after powering on the raspberry.


If you follow these steps correctly you can enjoy a nice cold drink with your friends!
